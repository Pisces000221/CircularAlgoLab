Some circular collision detecting algorithms with Cocos2d-x

Introduction
------------

Pi day finally comes!

To celebrate this special day, aside from remembering the 143rd digit of pi, we made this simple programme - the algorithms to detect collisions between circular shapes!

Contains algorithms for:

* Rectangles and points
* Circular sectors and points
* Circular sectors and circles

We'll keep this updated when we did something else!

And, if you're good at mathematics, fell free to fork this and send pull request to us!

Compilation requirements
------------------------
* Cocos2d-x 3.0-beta2 or later
* A computer that works well

Code reading requirements
-------------------------
* A brain which can deal with maths problems
* A code editor or whatever you like to display it
* A computer that works well
